##Assignment: Shell script to make a task easier
##This script creates a folder on my desktop named after the month and year and moves all of the files from the desktop into it

#!/bin/bash

MONTH=$(date +%m)

monthnames=(invalid January February March April May June July August September October November December)

MONTHNAME=${monthnames[${MONTH}]}

echo ${MONTHNAME}

time_stamp=${MONTHNAME}_$(date +%Y)
mkdir -p "$HOME/Desktop/${time_stamp}"

for f in $HOME/Desktop/*; do
    if [ -f "$f" ]; then
        mv "$f" $HOME/Desktop/${time_stamp}/
    fi
done
